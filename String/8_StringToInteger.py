    题目描述:

    Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

    Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself
     what are the possible input cases.

    Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to
    gather all the input requirements up front.

    Update (2015-02-10):
    The signature of the C++ function had been updated. If you still see your function signature accepts a const char *
    argument, please click the reload button  to reset your code definition.

    spoilers alert... click to show requirements for atoi.
